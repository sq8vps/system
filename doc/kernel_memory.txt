Page size is 4096 B.
Kernel virtual memory organization:
0xD0000000 - kernel image (128 MiB)
0xD8000000 - kernel heap (256 MiB)
0xE8000000 - kernel mode drivers (256 MiB)
0xF8000000 - dynamically mapped memory (124 MiB) - for memory mapped I/O and mapping previously allocated physical memory
0xFFC00000 - current process page tables (4 MiB - 4 kiB)
0xFFFFF000 - current process page directory (4 kiB)
Whole lower pool (below 0xD0000000) can be used by the bootloader to store some data and pass it to kernel.
