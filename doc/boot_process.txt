The boot process is as follows:
1. The 1st stage bootloader (boot.bin) is read from the MBR.
2. The 1st stage bootloader scans the boot drive for the 2nd stage bootloader (loader.bin) and loads it at 0x7E00 (lower memory).
3. The 2nd stage bootloader reads BIOS memory map and loads the 3rd stage bootloader (LDR32) from FAT32 partition to some 
free space in LOWER memory. Then it creates GDT, enables PM and jumps to the 3rd stage bootloader.
4. The 3rd stage bootloader reads the memory map provided by the 2nd stage bootloader and configures paging.
The kernel is loaded to some free space in HIGHER memory. The bootloader provides the usable memory map
and the list of loaded components, its virtual memory location and size to the kernel.
